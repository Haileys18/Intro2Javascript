  <p id="p">Today I learned about how to chnage color of different ids in javascript using a button to make the code work. The first tag we learned new was 'function' that is used to make a code work as a action. In this code you have to add the id of the thing that is wanted to change and put .getElementById("id").style.color="color" or .body.style.backgroundColor="color" this is all done before document tage and inside a curly bracket '}'. The when this is connected to the button 'onclick' is added as an attribute making it clickable. When button is clicked the javascript code is preformed.</p>
  <button onclick="p()">Change Pragraph Here!</button>
  <button onclick="night()"> Dark mode</button>
  <script src="script.js"> 
  </script>
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Click Here</button>
